# POWER-BI-DAATA-VISUALISATION
Respected Person, Greetings to you 

The Following POWER BI Project was a workshop: Where We analysed and visualised data in the Power BI software, The data Consists from the perspective of a product where there are multiple components of analysation
Firstly we have the Sales person and the tree connects with the other elements which are 
1. Product, 2. Region, 3. item cost, 4. The customer, 5. the date it was sold on, 6. No of items which were sold, 7. How much was the cost of it,8. The margin and the revenue we made

Now that we have the clear idea about the variables: it makes us understand that the data is solely based on the sales
We analysed and Visualised in the Visualisation tool

[kindly check the screenshot for better understandung] Data Visualisation Explanation: 
In the above analysis continued with the data visualization :
We have figured out Multiple questions from the point of REVENUE AND COST on the basis of SALES 

Firstly We would like to congratulate the Global stores for the profit they have achieved in the year of 2021-22
1. We figured out that the Average revenue with was contributed by all the team person and we found out : Bajaj, birbal were the one who brough more of the sales 

2. And we can also understand the sum of the revenue which was generated by each product And we figured out which product amount costed the more in the whole production which was BAMBOO FOAM COUCH

Thirdly we also analyzed how the most number of sales were by our clients through STYLE AND SPA , in second position was Metro 

Lastly we understood that the Product Bamboo Foam Couch had more amount of Fans than Shahrukh khan, So I think focusing on the product and bringing the varieties and sell it premium to normal ranges of the product would bring us for more revenue generation as  Metro Comes second and First comes the SPA and styling where we have the niche market.

However we have to also focus on the average  of how the sales were in every quarter 

Thank you.
