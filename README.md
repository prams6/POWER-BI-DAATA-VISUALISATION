# POWER-BI-DAATA-VISUALISATION
Respected Person, Greetings to you 

The Following POWER BI Project was a workshop: Where We analysed and visualised data in the Power BI software 

The data Consists from the perspective of a product where there are multiple components of analysation
Firstly we have the Sales person and the tree connects with the other elements which are 
1. Product
2. Region
3. item cost
4. The customers
5. the date it was sold on
6. No of items which were sold
7. How much was the cost of it
8. The margin and the revenue we made

Now that we have the clear idea about the variables: it makes us understand that the data is solely based on the sales
We analysed and Visualised in the Visualisation tool

Power BI is just like excel but in the premium version of data visualisation Following below you can check the visualisation: Where I have made a conncting tree which will show how much one person has made a sale and how much growth has been generated by one sales person.
